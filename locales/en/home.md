Former lab name: KI2 (Knowledge Inference Systems II) Laboratory.

This laboratory studies links between computation and the real world. Topics include nonlinear physics, artificial intelligence, biological phenomena, high-performance computing, and xReality. The goal is to understand complex systems and create new intelligent experiences, from analyzing quantum chaos and collective dynamics to exploring massively parallel computation and VR/AR applications.
